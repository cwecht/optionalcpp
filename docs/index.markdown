Welcome to our journey from a simple strcut to a working 
[std::optional](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional) implementation.
It is recommended to start with the [about page](/about), as there are all
targets and assumptions layed out. These posts are consecutive, so it is recommended to 
start with the first post and to progress chronologically. But you may also skip one or
another posts, if you are already familiar with the particular topic.
