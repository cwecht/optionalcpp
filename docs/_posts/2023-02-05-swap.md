## Some algorithms need to swap

One of the benefits of [regular types]({% post_url 2022-01-23-regular-optional %}) is, that they can
easily be used with STL's containers and algorithms. A group of STL algorithms does only move around 
the elements in it's input ranges; they do neither remove nor add elements there; they only 
change the ordering of the elements -- they only *permute* them (Jonathan Boccara calls them 
[permutationers](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2018/07/06/world-map-cpp-stl-algorithms/) for exactly this
reason. They include popular algorithms like

* [std::sort](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/sort),
* [std::stable_sort](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/stable_sort),
* [std::partial_sort](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/partial_sort),
* [std::nth_element](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/nth_element),
* [std::partition](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/partition),
* [std::stable_partition](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/stable_partition),
* [std::rotate](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/rotate),
* [std::reverse](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/reverse),
* [std::next_permutation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/next_permutation) or
* [std::random_shuffle](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/random_shuffle).

All of them need to move around elements in the input range. This "moving around" usually comes up
in the form of *swapping*. Let's have a look at a rather simple example: `std::random_shuffle`. This
is a very simple (and somewhat flawed becasue of `std::rand`) implementation taken from
[cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/random_shuffle#Possible_implementation):

{% highlight cpp %}
template<class RandomIt>
void random_shuffle(RandomIt first, RandomIt last) {
  typedef typename std::iterator_traits<RandomIt>::difference_type diff_t;
  typedef typename std::iterator_traits<RandomIt>::value_type value_type;
 
  for (diff_t i = last - first - 1; i > 0; --i) {
    value_type& a = first[i];
    value_type& b = first[std::rand() % (i + 1)];
    value_type tmp = a;
    a = b;
    b = tmp;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This implementation of `random_shuffle` exchanges every element in the range with another randomly chosen
other element in the range -- it *swaps* them. This `swapping` is commonly used in permutating algorithms,
so STL offers a function template for that: [std::swap](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/swap).
A possible generic implementation could look like this:

{% highlight cpp %}
template<typename T>
void swap(T& a, T& b  {
  T tmp = a;
  a = b;
  b = tmp;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Please note that this implementation need to make a copy of one of those values. This is unfortunate for objects which
are expensive to copy such as large `std::vector`s. This is unfortunate especially since `swap` can be implemented for
`std::vector` in particular quite efficiently.

{% highlight cpp %}
template<class RandomIt>
void random_shuffle(RandomIt first, RandomIt last) {
  typedef typename std::iterator_traits<RandomIt>::difference_type diff_t;
 
  for (diff_t i = last - first - 1; i > 0; --i) {
    std::swap(first[i], first[std::rand() % (i + 1)])
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Using `std::swap` not only simplifies this implementation massively. If also has performance benefits. 

![copy vector visualization]({{site.url}}/images/copy_vector.svg){: width="740" }

The image above show what needs to be happen in order top assign a `std::vector` to another 
(for more details have look at [this article](https://frogatto.com/2009/11/17/how-cs-vector-works-the-gritty-details/)):
each value of the source vector needs to be copied to the target vector. Note that in the show case the capacity of the
target vector is already large enough to fit all elements; in the general case an allocation may be necessary.
In the generic implementation of `swap` two assignments and one copy is happening.
Depending on circumstances, these might require quite a lot allocations and copying of elements!

![swap vector visualization]({{site.url}}/images/swap_vector.svg){: width="740" }

In contrast to that swapping two vectors is really cheap as we only need to swap the pointer to the beginning, the end
and end of capacity to the vector. This is an obvious win over two assignments and a copy of entire (potentially large)
vectors!

For this reason and because this is true for many other STL containers/types, there are overloads of `std::swap` for
each of them. `std::vector` actually has a
[member function called swap](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/swap) for this reason.

As having a specific implementation of swap may be beneficial in many case, we really should provide an overload
for our optional as well. The C++ Core Guidelines recommend
[to do so as well](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c83-for-value-like-types-consider-providing-a-noexcept-swap-function).

## Swapping optionasls

Following the example of `std::vector` we will have a *member function* `swap` and a free function `swap`.
The free function is beneficial to have in the general case; the member function is arguably easier to use
-- at least if you are using and IDE with autocompletion. For a discussion about this topic please have a look
at [Klaus Iglberger's talk on Free Function](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/swap). As people
like to use member functions and it doesn't hurt to much to provide them, we'll just do it. 
And `std::optional` has a [swap member function](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional/swap), too.

## The swap member functions.

As a quick preliminary remark I would to emphasis that we should use the swap operation of optional's value type.
Form the discussion above this should be quite obvious that this makes quite some sense.

As we should start with writing test cases for our new swap function first, we need to provide a first dummy
implementation of `optional::swap`.

{% highlight cpp %}
template <typename T>
class optional {
 public:
 //...
  void swap(optional& other) {}
 //...
};
{% endhighlight %}

After thinking a bit about the problem at hand we will quickly see, that there are four cases to distinguish here:

1. both optionals store a value.
2. both optionals store no value.
3. optional a stores a value but optional b doesn't.
4. optional a stores no value but optional b doesn't.

Based on these distinction of cases, we can derive these test cases.

{% highlight cpp %}
TEST_CASE(
    "If two optionals with values are swapped, their values are swapped.") {
  unsigned int anyValueX = 10;
  unsigned int anyValueY = 2;
  optional_unsigned_int x(anyValueX);
  optional_unsigned_int y(anyValueY);

  x.swap(y);

  REQUIRE(*x == anyValueY);
  REQUIRE(*y == anyValueX);
}

TEST_CASE("If two optionals with no values are swapped, they stay empty.") {
  optional_unsigned_int x;
  optional_unsigned_int y;

  x.swap(y);

  REQUIRE(not x.has_value());
  REQUIRE(not y.has_value());
}

TEST_CASE(
    "If an optional with a value and an optional without a value are swapped, "
    "the value is transferred.") {
  unsigned int anyValueX = 10;
  optional_unsigned_int x(anyValueX);
  optional_unsigned_int y;

  SECTION("this has value") {
    x.swap(y);
  }
  SECTION("other has value") {
    y.swap(x);
  }

  REQUIRE(not x.has_value());
  REQUIRE(y.has_value());
  REQUIRE(*y == anyValueX);
}
{% endhighlight %}

We now need to address these these cases in out implementation.

1. For case 1 we can just use `std::swap` on the values of the optionals.
2. For case 2 there is basically nothing to do: there are no values to care about and swapping 
  to booleans with the same value doesn't make that much sense.
3. In case 3 and 4 we can just copy the value of the optional with the value to the optional without a value and destroy
   the old value.

{% highlight cpp %}
template <typename T>
class optional {
 public:
 //...
  void swap(optional& other) {
    if (this->has_value() and other.has_value()) {
      std::swap(*(*this), *other);
    } else if (this->has_value()) {
      other.constructValue(*(*this));
      other.mHasValue = true;
      this->destructValue();
      this->mHasValue = false;
    } else if (other.has_value()) {
      this->constructValue(*other);
      this->mHasValue = true;
      other.destructValue();
      other.mHasValue = false;
    }
  }
 //...
};
{% endhighlight %}

This implementation will make the tests pass but it is a bit cumbersome as we need to quite a log of manual work here in
case 3 and 4. We should revisit `constructValue` and `destructValue`. If any of them is called it is always accompanied
with an assignment to `mHasValue`: if `constructValue` is called `mHasValue` is set to `true` and if `destructValue` is
called `mHasValue` is set to false. This makes a lot of sense since `mHasValue` denotes whether there is a *constructed
object* stored in the optional. We might as well always set `mHaveValue` accordingly in both of these function calls and
save us some code even in other places of our implementation.

{% highlight cpp %}
template <typename T>
class optional {
 public:
 //...
  optional& operator=(const optional& other) {
    if (mHasValue && other.mHasValue) {
      *(*this) = *other;
    } else if (other.mHasValue) {
      constructValue(*other);
    } else if (mHasValue) {
      destructValue();
    }
    return *this;
  }
 //...
  void swap(optional& other) {
    if (this->has_value() and other.has_value()) {
      std::swap(*(*this), *other);
    } else if (this->has_value()) {
      other.constructValue(*(*this));
      this->destructValue();
    } else if (other.has_value()) {
      this->constructValue(*other);
      other.destructValue();
    }
  }
 //...
 private:
 //...
  void constructValue(const T& other) {
    new (&mBuffer.mStorage) T(other);
    mHasValue = true;
  }

  void destructValue() {
    reinterpret_cast<T*>(&mBuffer.mStorage)->~T();
    mHasValue = false;
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

## Free function swap

Implementing the free function `swap` is now actually quite easy, but we should still add a test for it.

{% highlight cpp %}
TEST_CASE("Free Function swap called on options swaps the optionals") {
  unsigned int anyValueX = 10;
  optional_unsigned_int x(anyValueX);
  optional_unsigned_int y;

  swap(x, y);

  REQUIRE(not x.has_value());
  REQUIRE(y.has_value());
  REQUIRE(*y == anyValueX);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Given that, we can not add our implementation, which just forwards to the member function `swap`.

{% highlight cpp %}
template< class T >
void swap(optional<T>& a, optional<T>& b ) {
  a.swap(b);
}
{% endhighlight %}

But where to put it? We could just put it in the global namespace, but in general it is considered bad practice
(yes, we do it all the time here, but we did it only for the sake of simplicity!).
As it is intended as an overload of `std::swap` we could add it to the `std` namespace, right? No we can't! Because in
general it is undefined behavior to add
[declarations to the `std` namespace](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/extending_std). There are exceptions,
but `std::swap` isn't one of them.

We could add `swap` as a `friend` function though. We did it with the 
[comparison operators before]({% post_url 2022-02-13-equality-inequality %}).

{% highlight cpp %}
template <typename T>
class optional {
 public:
 //...
  friend void swap(optional& a, optional& b ) {
    a.swap(b);
  }
 //...
};
{% endhighlight %}

Doing this has some nice properties:
1. `swap` will now always be in the same namespace. The C++ Core Guidelines
  [recommend that](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c165-use-using-for-customization-points)
  as well -- we'll get back to that.
2. We save quite some boilerplate code as we can spare the `template` line we otherwise would have to add.
3. `swap` is now consistently implemented like the comparison operators. If you think about, `swap` can be considered
  to be a binary operator like `+` or `-` but with
  [prefix instead of infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation).

## On the usage of swap

Consider the following code:

{% highlight cpp %}
optional<int> a, b;
std::swap(a, b);
{% endhighlight %}

Will this code call our swap implementation? No, it won't! It will call the default implementation of swap.
This implies, that the example implementation of `std::random_shuffle' we used above won't use it either.
The reason for that is that I ruthlessly simplified the implementation above. An actual implementation would
look more like this:

{% highlight cpp %}
template<class RandomIt>
void random_shuffle(RandomIt first, RandomIt last) {
  typedef typename std::iterator_traits<RandomIt>::difference_type diff_t;
 
  for (diff_t i = last - first - 1; i > 0; --i) {
    using std::swap;
    swap(first[i], first[std::rand() % (i + 1)])
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

With such an implementation our swap function is actually called. With `using std::swap;` we pull in `std::swap` in
the global namespace (for the current scope). Now *all* overloads of `std::swap` and our implementation of swap are
considered for overload resolution. Knowing that, we should now revisit our `swap` implementation as we did not
considered such a case there.

{% highlight cpp %}
template <typename T>
class optional {
 public:
 //...
  void swap(optional& other) {
    if (this->has_value() and other.has_value()) {
      using std::swap;
      swap(*(*this), *other);
    } else if (this->has_value()) {
      other.constructValue(*(*this));
      this->destructValue();
    } else if (other.has_value()) {
      this->constructValue(*other);
      other.destructValue();
    }
  }
 //...
};
{% endhighlight %}

This code will actually work for all type which have an implementation of swap within their namespace.
The reason for that is called [argument-dependent lookup](https://abseil.io/tips/49).
To put it quick and simple: ADL means that, if you call a function without any scope specificaion in front of it (any
kind of `::`) during overload resolution the compiler will also look in the namespaces of its operands.
ADL has originally been added to C++ because of operator overloading, but works for every kind of function.
This is the reason why
the c++ core guidelines suggest to put operator overloads into the
[same namespace as their
operands](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c168-define-overloaded-operators-in-the-namespace-of-their-operands).

ADL makes also the ["Making News Friends" idiom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POa_V15je8Y) work which we are using
for the comparison operators and `swap`. These functions are not part of the global namespace but part of the class
namespace of `optional`. We can only call them because of ADL.

## Conclusion

In this post we learned 
* about `std::swap` and it's merits especially in STL algorithms. If you want to see how commonly `swap` is used
  in the STL, just have a look in
  [an implementation](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/8.x/libcxx/include/algorithm) and count the
  occourances!
* how to implement swap for our optional,
* how to use `swap` in generic code and
* what ADL means and how to use it.

In a sense `std::swap` is a child of older C++ versions. With the introduction of 
[move semantics](https://hellocplusplus.com/move-semantics-the-basics/) in C++11 the need for providing a custom 
implementation of `swap` has become less urgent, as `std::swap` can be implemented in terms of move semenatics
quite efficiently in general. However we will keep sticking with C++98 a bit further as there are still a few helpful
thing we can implement in C++98 before we actually need to move on to C++11.
