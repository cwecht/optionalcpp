## Assign for reset

[Recently]({% post_url 2023-02-24-reset %}) we we introduced `optional::reset()` to make any optional
empty. To some extent we did this to be consistent with the
[smart pointers]({% post_url 2023-02-24-reset %}#conclusion)
as they also have such `reset` function. It runs out that there is a mechanism for archiving the same
thing as call `reset()` on a smart pointer *and* which works for *raw pointers*, too: we can assign a
null pointer (`nullptr`). It would be quite nice to have something similar for out optional, too!

## Something like a nullptr for optional

In order to make clear what we want to archive, let's have a look at a simple example first!
For `std::unique_ptr` in C++11 we could write something like this:

{% highlight cpp %}
std::unique_ptr<int> ptr;
ptr = nullptr;
{% endhighlight %}

Please note that this only possible in C++11 not only because
[std::unique_ptr](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr) has been introduced in C++11 but also
because [nullptr](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/nullptr) has been added to the language in C++11, too.

In C++11 there are two new things with regard to null pointers:
 * the *type* [std::nullptr_t](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/nullptr_t) and
 * the *literal* [nullptr](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/nullptr) of type `std::nullptr_t`.

*Both* are important here. `nullptr` (the literal) is needed in order to be able to write the code above.
The type `std::nullptr_t` allows the definition of an *overload* of `unique_ptr`'s assignment operator for
exactly that case. This overload of the assignment operator has the same effect as calling `reset()`.

We need something similar for `optional`. We *can* and *should* not use `nullptr` though because:
1. As we are still using C++98 we *cannot* use `nullptr`, because it's not available yet.
2. In case of a function overloaded for a pointer and a optional
  [this will cause an ambiguity](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15070862/can-a-unique-ptr-take-a-nullptr-value)
  -- we will get back to that.

So we need to come up with our own solution for that: we need another *type* and a *constant* for this reason.
This is what [nullopt_t](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional/nullopt_t) and
[nullopt](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional/nullopt). Defining `nullopt_t` is quite easy: an empty
`struct` will suffice. Given that, we can already implement the new overload for the assignment operator.

{% highlight cpp %}
struct nullopt_t {};

const nullopt_t nullopt;
//...

template <typename T>
class optional {
 // ...
 public:
 // ...
  optional& operator=(nullopt_t) {
    reset();
    return *this;
  }
 // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

Please note, that the overload -- just as the [original one]({% post_url 2022-06-26-copy-assignment-revisited %}) --
return's a reference to the optional it self. This enables a notation like `a = b = nullopt`.

Based on the test cases for `reset()` we
[already introduced before]({% post_url 2023-02-24-reset%}#tests-for-reset) we can derive new test cases for this new
assignment operator.

{% highlight cpp %}
TEST_CASE(
    "Assigning nullopt to an optional with a value resets the optional.") {
  int anyValueX = 5;
  optional<int> x(anyValueX);
  REQUIRE(x);
  x = nullopt;
  REQUIRE(not x);
}

TEST_CASE(
    "After assigning a nullopt to an optional without a value has still a value.") {
  optional<int> x;
  REQUIRE(not x);
  x = nullopt;
  REQUIRE(not x);
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Another constructor

We can now write this code:

{% highlight cpp %}
optional<int> x;
x = nullopt;
{% endhighlight %}

*But* we cannot write this code:

{% highlight cpp %}
optional<int> x = nullopt;
{% endhighlight %}

The reason for that is, that in this case the assignment operator is not used: we need another constructor for this
case.

We can easily derive a suitable test case...

{% highlight cpp %}
TEST_CASE("An optional initialized from nullopt has no value.") {
  const optional_unsigned_int x = nullopt;
  REQUIRE(!x);
}
{% endhighlight %}

... and add the missing constructor.

{% highlight cpp %}
template <typename T>
class optional {
 // ...
 public:
 // ...
  optional(nullopt_t)
      : mHasValue(false) {}
 // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Equality

Assignment and construction from `nullopt` is now possible -- just as we can assign a null pointer to any other pointer.
But what else can we do with a null pointer? We can use it in order to check whether a pointer stores a null pointer!
In order to extend our analogy between pointers and optionals even further it makes sense to have the ability to check
whether an optional is empty by comparing in with `nullopt`. As usual we will write tests covering this behavior first:

{% highlight cpp %}
TEST_CASE("An optional without a value equals nullopt.") {
  const optional_unsigned_int x;
  REQUIRE(x == nullopt);
  REQUIRE(nullopt == x);
  REQUIRE(!(x != nullopt));
  REQUIRE(!(nullopt != x));
}

TEST_CASE("An optional with a value does not equal nullopt.") {
  unsigned int anyValue = 10;
  const optional_unsigned_int x(anyValue);
  REQUIRE(!(x == nullopt));
  REQUIRE(!(nullopt == x));
  REQUIRE(x != nullopt);
  REQUIRE(nullopt != x);
}
{% endhighlight %}

If we try to compile our tests now we will get a compiler error:

{% highlight cpp %}
In file included from /home/user/optionalcpp/tests/tests.cpp:2:
/home/user/optionalcpp/include/optional.hpp: In instantiation of ‘bool operator==(const optional<T>&, const U&) [with U = nullopt_t; T = unsigned int]’:
/home/user/optionalcpp/tests/tests.cpp:18:3:   required from here
/home/user/optionalcpp/include/optional.hpp:170:15: error: no match for ‘operator==’ (operand types are ‘const unsigned int’ and ‘const nullopt_t’)
  170 |     return *a == b;
{% endhighlight %}

The reason for that are the overloads for the `==` and `!=` operator we had introduced as an optimization for
[heterogeneous comparisons]({% post_url 2022-08-27-more-efficient-comparisons %}): the non-optional parameter will
happily take anything we pass to -- including `nullopt`. Therefor the respective overload will be chosen which then
causes compilation to fail because `nullopt` can usually not be compared with the value type.

Hence, we need to provide separate overloads for these cases:

{% highlight cpp %}
template <typename T>
class optional {
 // ...
 public:
 // ...
  friend bool operator==(nullopt_t, const optional& b) {
     return not b.mHasValue;
  }

  friend bool operator==(const optional& a, nullopt_t) {
     return nullopt == a;
  }
 // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

With these two our tests compile successfully and all our tests succeed.

Please note that we didn't need to provide the respective overloads for `!=`. The reason for that is
that we implemented the [heterogeneous overloads]({% post_url 2022-08-27-more-efficient-comparisons %}) 
of the `!=` operator in terms of the `==` operator. If we try to compare an optional with a `nullopt` using
the `!=` operator, the compiler will take the heterogeneous overload of it -- just as it did it for `==` above.
But in this case the compilation success because here we are delegating to the `==` operator, which we just 
had implemented.

## The Other Comparisons

As we now have `==` and `!=` for `nullopt` it makes sense to also introduce the over comparison operators.
We can treat `nullopt` just like an optional without a value, so that the same rule for the comparison operators
apply: an `nullopt` is always considered to be smaller than an optional *with* a value. Given that we can add
appropriated tests rather easily:

{% highlight cpp %}
TEST_CASE("An optional without a value equals nullopt.") {
  const optional_unsigned_int x;
  REQUIRE(x == nullopt);
  REQUIRE(x <= nullopt);
  REQUIRE(x >= nullopt);
  REQUIRE(nullopt == x);
  REQUIRE(nullopt <= x);
  REQUIRE(nullopt >= x);
  REQUIRE(!(x != nullopt));
  REQUIRE(!(x < nullopt));
  REQUIRE(!(x > nullopt));
  REQUIRE(!(nullopt != x));
  REQUIRE(!(nullopt < x));
  REQUIRE(!(nullopt > x));
}

TEST_CASE("An optional with a value does not equal nullopt.") {
  unsigned int anyValue = 10;
  const optional_unsigned_int x(anyValue);
  REQUIRE(!(x == nullopt));
  REQUIRE(!(x <= nullopt));
  REQUIRE(!(nullopt == x));
  REQUIRE(!(nullopt >= x));
  REQUIRE(x != nullopt);
  REQUIRE(nullopt != x);
}

TEST_CASE("An optional with a value greater than nullopt.") {
  unsigned int anyValue = 10;
  const optional_unsigned_int x(anyValue);
  REQUIRE(x > nullopt);
  REQUIRE(x >= nullopt);
  REQUIRE(nullopt < x);
  REQUIRE(nullopt <= x);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Just as [we did before]({% post_url 2022-02-20-order %}#2022-02-20-order) I've chosen to extend the equality and
inequality test case a bit in order to avoid duplication. Based on that we can now implement the `<` operator.

{% highlight cpp %}
template <typename T>
class optional {
 // ...
 public:
 // ...
  friend bool operator<(nullopt_t, const optional& b) {
     return b.mHasValue;
  }

  friend bool operator<(const optional& a, nullopt_t) {
     return false;
  }
 // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

The new tests will compile and succeed now. There are two things noteworthy here:
 * again, it is enough to add overload to the `<` operator. This is (again) because of the
   [heterogeneous comparisons]({% post_url 2022-08-27-more-efficient-comparisons %}) and the fact that 
   the other comparison operators are implemented in terms of `<`.
 * We have an interesting *asymmetry* here: it depends on the order of the operands whether the optional matters or not.
   If we give it a seconds thought, this makes totally sense: an optional can never the less than an optional without a
   value. If can be greater or equal to it but never less.

## Conclusion

Once again we took the syntax of pointer as a guiding line for extending the design of optional: we introduced `nullopt`
as an null pointer equivalent. We anticipated the introduction of `nullptr` in C++11, but we could implement
`nullopt_t` and `nullopt` in C++98 already. We can now write:

* `optional<T> x; x = nullopt`,
* `optional<T> x = nullopt`,
* `x == nullopt` and e.g.
* `x < nullopt`

We introduced `nullopt` as a *global variable*. For the moment this works quite well, but in general
globals may cause issues if
[used in the context of shared and static libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVT1y0xWgww&pp=ygUSYysrIGdsb2JhbHMgbGlua2Vy).
However, we will have a look at this in an upcoming post.
